### Install via Composer

at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev jsondune/phonebook-yii2 phonebook
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Create the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=phonebook-yii2',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '12345678',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTE:** Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.

Also check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application.

After the establishment of the project in the working directory, you must run the migration:
~~~
# yii migrate
~~~

After migration, use the following administrator and user accounts:

~~~
Login: admin 
Password: admin121345
~~~

~~~
Login: user1 
Password: 123456
~~~

To start the telephone book is in the working directory of the application, type the command:
```
# php -S localhost:8080 -t web
```

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL

~~~
http://localhost:8080
~~~
